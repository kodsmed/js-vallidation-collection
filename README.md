# validation-collection

A javascript class that contains a wide and growing range of methods for validating javascript variables, arrays and objects and provide useful feedback on points of failure in the validation process. Such as missing properties in an object or missing values in an array, unexpected properties in an object, unexpected value types, etc.

No more lengthy if statements with endless && or ||,  
No more undefined and null-checks,  
just a simple class that does the work for you.

## Installation

```` bash
npm install validation-collection
````

## Usage

### Importing the class

```` javascript
import Validation from 'validation';
````

## State of the project

Project is stable and ready for use.  
(but don't trust your bank account to my 30hours of coding.)

I will continue to add more methods to the class as I find the need for them, or they are requested.  
This will likely be the only validation ts/js class that I will need for the foreseeable future,  
so as long as I have the time, I will continue to develop it.

## Support

The package comes packed with 6 automated test-suits with a whooping 4203 tests... However,  
I develop this package in my spare time, so it is fully possible that I have missed something.  
Also, I can't guarantee that I will be able to help you with any issues you might encounter.  
However, I will welcome your feedback, I will do my best to help you out if you have any questions, suggestions or issues.  
Please create an issue on the [github repository](https://github.com/kodsmed/js-vallidation-collection/issues).  
I will try to respond as soon as possible.
